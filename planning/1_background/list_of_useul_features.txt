A non exhaustive list of features that I found useful

1. Online acc√®s to bookings, cross platform.

2. Online booking.

3. Appointment confirmation/reminder emails.

4. Write notes: treatment, appointment

5. Recurring appointments

6. Take payments - produce custom receipts

7. Dashboard - see useful stuff as soon as you log in, I.e. list of treatment notes to complete.

8. Set special requirments notes for client that always pop up booking etc - ie serve nut allergy, or can not lie on back needs special equipment.  Not always implemented very well though!


I will add to these as I remember features....
