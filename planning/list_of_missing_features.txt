A non exhaustive list of features that I have found to be missing or have poor functionality.

1. Sharing client data between practitioners.
	- Choose team members add set access privileges to view/edit/delete client info
	- Choose non team members and non group members
	- effectively refer clients between practitioners
	- track progress
	- adhere to data protection

2. Practitioners loose access to data when they leave a clinic
	- make practitioner logins that exist out-with clinic/shop/gym/group structure

3. Poor appointment search and filtering
	- clients are not properly assigned to practitioners. Should show in list if attended an appointment with practitioner.
	- easily create day, week month lists of practitioners clients, categorise by: appointment type, to pay, paid, practitioner, date etc
	- easily get list of contact details for marketing emails, filter by signed up to receive marketing.

4. Generic UI components with fields that I never populated.

5. Dashboards that are not customisable

6. Treatment note reminders - in line with good practice guidelines


I will add to these features as I remembers ideas....
