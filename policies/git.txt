Suggested policy for git commits

1. Commits should be done for completed features.

2. Messages should provide enough information to allow identification of what features are present in the build. Example:

	template - "Type of changes - what has been changed - how it has been changed."
	example. - "Function - classnames - added example method to provide example.
		   Testing - ClassTests - test exampleTest created - passed."

3. Branching and Merging - tbc
